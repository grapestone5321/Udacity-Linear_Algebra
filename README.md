## 1. Linear Algebra Refresher Course
A Brief Refresher (with Python!)

This mini-course is intended for students who would like a refresher on the basics of linear algebra. 

The course attempts to provide the motivation for "why" linear algebra is important in addition to "what" linear algebra is.

Students will learn concepts in linear algebra by applying them in computer programs. 

At the end of the course, you will have coded your own personal library of linear algebra functions that you can use to solve real-world problems.

## 2. Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues
Concepts in Linear Algebra

One of the most interesting topics to visualize in Linear Algebra are Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues. 

Here you will learn how to easily calculate them and how they are applicable and particularly interesting when it comes to machine learning implementations.
